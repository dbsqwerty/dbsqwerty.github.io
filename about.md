## Who are you even

* I'm Sean, a nearly 16 year old Kid who likes CTF and Forensics
* I'm kinda newb but I've been learning/trying since 2020
* Apart from CTF, I'm also interested in Robotics, 3D-Printing and CAD 
* Maybe I'll put up posts about my side-projects such as building my own 3d printer etc.

## Why got nothing sia

* Maybe I'll upload stuff, maybe I won't. Who knows... Life is unpredictable.

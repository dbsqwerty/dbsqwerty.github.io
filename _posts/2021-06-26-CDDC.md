Oh boy, this CTF was one crazy ride if you were inside too. From misconfigured servers to wrong flags, this was one ~~epic~~ ride. Through this somewhat chaotic CTF, (not) my (usual) team managed to achieve 1st place after an excruciating tie breaker. I would like to thank my team members for adopting me into their team despite this somewhat unusual arrangement. 

### Where writeups?

To be honest, this CTF was one of the easiest CTF I participated in. Most challenges can really be solved in just one command or simply by using a tool. Therefore there will not be any writeups as there simply is no point to do writeups for challenges with a 1 step solution. For challenges with a solution of more than 1 step, those were honestly somewhat guessy and not deserving of a writeup. 

### Feedback

Yes, this CTF was not the CTF most of us were expecting. This is not meant to flame or to offend anyone but merely just issues that should be taken note and improved in future editions of CDDC. 

* Platform deployed should be resilient to the load generated from participants. In this event, the platform crashed, hanged and was down due to the load. 
* Challenges should be tested to ensure no misconfiguration has taken place. There were several challenges that were misconfigured, resulting in flag leaks and privilege escalation that should not have been allowed in the first place. 
* Servers should be secured and not vulnerable unless intended to be. Similar to the above point, there was a massive breakdown for one Mission when the Linux server was taken over and broken. 
* Clear communication between participants and admins. This was honestly a trigger point for many teams including our team. Going forward, updates or changes to challenges should be clearly announced. Additionally, admins could have a common answer instead of multiple admins giving differing answers (which were sometimes wrong). 
* Better discord moderation. There was a fair bit of questionable behaviour and messages. Put simply, more could be done in terms of discord moderation and the setting up of the discord server. 
* Increased difficulty level. Personally, this CTF was too simple as most challenges can be solved with merely 1 step, which is uncommon for a CTF. Going forward, I believe we can definitely have events and CTFs where the difficulty level is much easier but there must be a clear distinction between events targeted at beginners and events targeted at veterans/experienced players. 

### Overall

While this CTF was slightly chaotic and has lots of room for improvement, it was still an honour for me to be able to compete against experienced veterans` Team Waifu` (HCI Sieberrsec) as well as `Team Social Engineering Experts`.  Hopefully we can have a much better CTF experience next year in `CDDC 2022`.
